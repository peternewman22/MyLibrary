       "    'description': 'Critical praise for A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling \"...a treasure house of material for students and teachers alike...can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic.\"-London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\"-SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards...to novelty ... Each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically.\"-Mathematical Reviews Michael Mesterton-Gibbons has done what no author before him could: he has written an in-depth, systematic guide to the art and science of mathematical modelling that\\'s a great read from first page to last. With an abundance of both wit and common sense, he shows readers exactly how the modelling process works, using fascinating real-life examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. You\\'ll find models for determining how fast cars drive through a tunnel; how many workers industry should employ; the length of a supermarket checkout line; how birds should select worms; the best methods for avoiding an automobile accident; and when a barber should hire an assistant; just to name a few. Offering more examples, more detailed explanations, and by far, more sheer enjoyment than any other book on the subject, A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling is the ultimate how-to guide for students and professionals in the hard sciences, social sciences, engineering, computers, statistics, economics, politics, business management, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.

      "description : From the No. 1 bestselling author of What If? - the man who created xkcd and explained the laws of science with cartoons - comes a series of brilliantly simple diagrams ('blueprints' if you want to be complicated about it) that show how important things work: from the nuclear bomb to the biro. It's good to know what the parts of a thing are called, but it's much more interesting to know what they do. Richard Feynman once said that if you can't explain something to a first-year student, you don't really get it. In Thing Explainer, Randall Munroe takes a quantum leap past this: he explains things using only drawings and a vocabulary of just our 1,000 (or the ten hundred) most common words. Many of the things we use every day - like our food-heating radio boxes ('microwaves'), our very tall roads ('bridges'), and our computer rooms ('datacentres') - are strange to us. So are the other worlds around our sun (the solar system), the big flat rocks we live on (tectonic plates), and even the stuff inside us (cells). Where do these things come from? How do they work? What do they look like if you open them up? And what would happen if we heated them up, cooled them down, pointed them in a different direction, or pressed this button? In Thing Explainer, Munroe gives us the answers to these questions and many, many more. Funny, interesting, and always understandable, this book is for anyone -- age 5 to 105 -- who has ever wondered how things work, and why.\n",
